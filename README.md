# Admissions Dashboard – Power BI Project (from admission platform Parcoursup)

## Project Overview
This project presents a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize data from the FrenchParcoursup admissions platform.  
The goal is to evaluate the performance of the campaign, understand candidate behavior, and provide actionable insights for improving the admissions process in future sessions.

## Objectives
- Visualize the volume and evolution of applications throughout the campaign.  
- Identify trends by program, school, and region.  
- Analyze acceptance and withdrawal rates.  
- Provide a decision-support tool for educational stakeholders.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation
   - Cleaned and standardized raw files using Power Query.  
   - Removed duplicates and harmonized naming conventions (schools, programs, regions).

2. Data Modeling
   - Created relationships between tables (candidates, programs, institutions, results).  
   - Built custom DAX measures to calculate admission, acceptance, and withdrawal rates.

3. Visualization & Dashboard Design
   - Designed interactive dashboards with filters by academic year, region, and program.  
   - Included key metrics: number of applications, admission rates, final enrollments, etc.

## Key Insights
- Clear visibility on differences between academic programs and institutions.  
- Identification of regional trends and disparities.  
- Detection of bottlenecks in specific programs.  
- The dashboard supports data-driven decisions for future Parcoursup campaigns.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop – dashboard creation  
- Power Query – data cleaning and transformation  
- DAX – metrics and KPIs  
- Microsoft Excel – source files and pre-processing

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters by year, academy, and field of study  
- Dynamic KPIs and drill-down analysis  
- Clean and intuitive layout for non-technical users  
- Exportable visuals for reports and presentations  

## Data Privacy
The dataset used in the original report contains confidential information.  
For demonstration purposes, a mock version with anonymized data was used for this presentation and documentation.
